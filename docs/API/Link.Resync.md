    msg ← {opts} ⎕SE.Link.Resync ⍬

`Link.Resync` will re-synchronise your workspace and source directories. It is the best way to resume work if you have used [Link.Pause](Link.Pause.md) to temporarily stop watching the file system, or you have loaded a checkpoint workspace that might contain obsolete code, or you have any other reason to suspect that the contents of the active workspace no longer match the source directories.

If you had previously used [Link.Pause](Link.Pause.md), your links will no longer be in a paused state following a Resync - unless you explicitly set the `pause=yes` option.

**WARNING:** Resync is one of the most recent items of functionality added to Link, and should be considered somewhat experimental in Link 3.0. While this is the case, the default value for the `confirm`  option will be `list` ,  which means that Resync will display output documenting the updates that it intends to make. If there are any outstanding differences, you need to explicitly set `confirm=yes` to execute the synchronisation.

The current plan is that, once Resync reaches maturity, the default will become `confirm=yes`, and an optional [Crawler](/Crawler.md) will become available. The *Crawler* will run Resync in the background, from time to time, to keep. It is likely that this will happen in Link version 3.1, hopefully during the summer of 2021.
